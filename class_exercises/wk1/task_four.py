# Task 04
# Write code that declares a variable to represent temperature in Fahrenheit (F). Calculate and display the equivalent temperature in Celsius (C) by applying the following formula: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
# Display both values. For example:
# Fahrenheit: 89.6
# Celsius: 32
# Note: (Use the internet to compare your application result to see if the calculation is correct.)


F = 234
C = (F-32)*5/9

print( "Fahrenheit:", F)
print( "Celsius:", C)
